Go Graphics/Game engine


This is a simple Game engine written in Go.  It is really a thin wrapper around the go-gl wrapper.  Written a test of what it an do in the "Testing" section.  So far it seems pretty responsive with 5000 sprites drawn at once.

This project is still in it's infancy and has a minimal set of features.  Primarily; it can draw sprites on the screen and move them.
